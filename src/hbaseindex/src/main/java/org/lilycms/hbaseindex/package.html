<h1>Intro</h1>
<p>This package contains a library that aids in building and
  querying indexes on top of HBase, in Google App Engine datastore-style.
  This basically means querying by range-scanning on specifically constructed index tables.</p>

<p>The goal of this library is to hide the details of playing with HBase's byte[] row keys
  to construct indexes. Actually pushing data towards the index is not handled by this package.</p>

<p>Some background on the indexing approach in this package can be found in
  <a href="http://brunodumon.wordpress.com/2010/02/17/building-indexes-using-hbase-mapping-strings-numbers-and-dates-onto-bytes/"
          >this blog post</a>.</p>

<h1>General</h1>

<p>Each index corresponds to one HBase table.</p>

<p>The configuration of the indexes is stored in an HBase table, by
  default called "indexmeta".</p>

<h1>Usage</h1>

<h2>Creating (defining) an index</h2>

<pre>
  // If you do not want to use "indexmeta" for the index meta table name,
  // you can supply an additional argument to IndexManager
  IndexManager indexManager = new IndexManager(hbaseConf);

  IndexDefinition indexDef = new IndexDefinition("myindex");
  StringIndexFieldDefinition stringField = indexDef.addStringField("myStringField");
  // you can call methods on the stringField object to set further options on the field

  indexDef.addIntegerField("myIntField");

  indexManager.createIndex(indexDef);
</pre>

<p>Once created, the structure of an index cannot be changed.</p>

<h2>Updating an index</h2>

<pre>
  IndexManager indexManager = new IndexManager(hbaseConf);

  Index index = indexManager.getIndex("myindex");

  // Add many entries like this
  IndexEntry entry = new IndexEntry();
  entry.addField("myStringField", "foobar");
  entry.addField("myIntField", 55);
  index.addEntry(entry, Bytes.toBytes("identifier"));

  // The 'identifier' above is whatever you like as identifier for the
  // indexed object -- usually a row key in some other HBase table.

  // You can remove entries by calling removeEntry with the
  // same values and identifier. Updating consists of deleting
  // and re-adding.
</pre>

<h2>Querying an index</h2>

<pre>
  IndexManager indexManager = new IndexManager(hbaseConf);

  Index index = indexManager.getIndex("myindex");

  Query query = new Query();
  query.addEqualsCondition("myStringField", "foobar");
  query.setRangeCondition("myIntField", 50, 60);

  QueryResult result = index.performQuery(query);

  byte[] identifier;
  while ((identifier = result.next()) != null) {
    System.out.println(Bytes.toString(rowkey));
  }
</pre>

<p>You need to fill the query objects with equals conditions
  and optionally one range condition. You need to use the fields
  in the index from left to right, and only on the rightmost used
  field a range condition can be used.</p>

<p>Range conditions by default have inclusive bounds ('greater
  than or equals' and 'less than or equals'), but as
  you can find in the API exclusive bounds are also possible.</p>

<h1>Misc</h1>

<h2>Merging results from multiple indexes</h2>

<p>If you build up your queries such that each identifier in the result
  is unique, then you can merge results from multiple indexes as an
  "AND" or "OR" operation.</p>

<p>This is done by using the classes Conjunction or Disjunction.</p>

<p>The way it works is that you build up your two queries and obtain
  their results, and then supply them to a conjunction:</p>

<pre>
  QueryResult result1 = index.performQuery(query1);
  QueryResult result2 = index.performQuery(query2);

  Conjunction conjunction = new Conjunction(result1, result2);

  // Conjunction also implements the QueryResult interface, so
  // it is used in the same way

  byte[] identifier;
  while ((identifier = conjunction.next()) != null) {
    System.out.println(Bytes.toString(rowkey));
  }
</pre>

<p>If you want to combine more than two indexes, you could nest multiple
  Conjunctions.</p>

<h2>Null values</h2>

<p>Indexing and querying on null values is supported.</p>

<p>This works because in the index row key there is a meta-byte for
  each field which records if the field is null or not.</p>

<h2>Using key-value style indexes</h2>

<p>Note that you could create an index with "key" and "value" fields
  to create a more generic index, a bit like you would create a key-value
  table in a SQL database.</p>

<p>In this case, using a Conjunction with queryresults from the same
  table can be useful.</p>

<h2>NOT-queries</h2>

<p>NOT queries can be handled manually by combining two range queries.</p>
